    <h1 id = "india19"> Education in India during 1900s </h1>
    <p> In the 1900's, moms will only send their sons to school. Their daughters would do home
         chores. Only 1% of moms let their daughters also go to school. They used to study under a tree 
         and sit in the ground. The teacher has a blackboard and chalk to teach the students. Since you need 
         to pay to go to school in India, only the rich kids went to study. The poor kids went to work with
         their mom to earn money for their family. Even in schools, they only had one or two bathroom in
         the school, which had 20 to 30 kids. Some poor students who went to school used to study under 
        the streetlight after the sunsets down because only in rich houses there was electricity. 
        Students need to walk more than 7 miles to reach school. To conclude, in the 1900's in India, 
        education was rare to all kids to study.  </p>

<p>Now, they have free schools for the poor and paid schools for the people who can afford it. Most schools 
    have smart boards in their classroom. Students study under a building and sit in a desk and even, in 
    some schools, have A/C. There are plenty of bathrooms for the kids to use. Now, in many houses, from
     poor to the rich, all have access to electricity. So, there is no more studying under streetlights
    and getting mosquito bites. If you have more money you get a better education, if you don't have money
     you get a basic education. Now, there is school available closer to houses and less distance to walk.
     But, compared to the 1900's education has improved a lot and all genders can go to school and study.
     To conclude, now in India education is free to all but given in different ways.</p>

<p>During the 1900s, along with students of every age, immigrants sat in one classroom in rows and learning the same thing
     with one teacher. There were no electronical learning, just blackboard, chalks, and notebooks
      to copy it down.</p>

<p>Now, there is a different grade level for each ages. Immigrants get to take a test; with that result they will be put 
    in a different class to bring them equal to the US-citizen students. Smart technology is used in schools
     for learning, such us using iPads and Smart Boards in classrooms.</p>
