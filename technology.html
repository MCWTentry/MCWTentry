                <td style = "font-size: 15px;"> While colored TVs were invented, they were very expensive. Most middle-class houses had black-and-white TV. </td>
                <td style = "font-size: 15px; ">Now, most families have colored TVs. It's a commodity to middle-class living.</td>

                <td style = "font-size: 15px;">In the 1960s, internet was only an idea. It had began to develop, but it would be decades later before it would be considered important.</td>
                <td style = "font-size: 15px;">Now, the internet is a vast system that connects people from across the world. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the internet has become the main way we connect with one another. </td>

                <td style = "font-size: 15px;">In the 1960s, there were phones, but not like the ones we have today. They were dial phones attached to the wall or a table, meaning all they could do is call, and, you couldn't put it in your pocket. </td>
                <td style = "font-size: 15px;">Nowadays, phones aren't just used for calling, but for several other things. Phones nowdays can almost do anything, and they are a big part of our lives.</td>

                <td style = "font-size: 15px;">In the 1960s, computers were huge. The average people didn't have a computer. They were mainly used by big companies and the government.</td>
                <td style = "font-size: 15px;">Nowadays, computers are tiny. So tiny, that they can fit in an average backpack. Many people own computers, and they are used for personal things (for example, me making this website).</td>

                <td style = "font-size: 15px;">Digital cameras weren't around in the 1960s. </td>
                <td style = "font-size: 15px;">Digital cameras are heavily used today. </td>

                <td style = "font-size: 15px;">GPS was not invented at this time. To navigate, people used maps, which were not as convinient.</td>
                <td style = "font-size: 15px;">Nowadays, GPS systems are incredibly complex. You can put in directions for most anywhere and are given the quickest route to get there. It's magic.</td>

                <td style = "font-size: 15px;">In the new decade, people wanted smaller cars, so cars like the Ford Falcon, Chevrolet Corvair and the Plymouth Valiant.</td>
                <td style = "font-size: 15px;">Now, cars have so many more features. Some cars can connect to the internet, and self-driving cars are not far away.</td>
