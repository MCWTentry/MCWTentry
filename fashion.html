    <h2>Women</h2>
    <p>In the 1960s, geometric dresses were in style. For evening wear, full-skirted evening gowns were worn. In the 1960's, women began to wear trousers and other formerly masculine clothing. This was their way of demanding equal rights for women; as they are the same in the end. In 2020, the main points are pastel colors, bold colors, and a monochromatic look. Skirts are also in season.</p>
